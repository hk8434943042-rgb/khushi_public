### **DASHBOARD STATISTICS**

#### Get Dashboard Stats

Returns overall counts plus revenue figures. `total_revenue` is the lifetime amount collected; the new `month_revenue` field reports the sum of payments that occurred in the current month (YYYY‑MM). The frontend dashboard uses `month_revenue` to calculate the "Fees Collected (current month)" KPI.

```
GET /api/stats/dashboard

Response:
{
  "total_students": 150,
  "total_teachers": 25,
  "total_revenue": 750000,
  "month_revenue": 32000,
  "pending_payments": 12
}
```
